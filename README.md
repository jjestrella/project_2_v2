# project_2_v2

Overview -
In this project we will create a machine learning model based on the premise that whether a customer will churn or not.  The algorithm we are going to use is K-Means. We will source the dataset from Kaggle and aim to achieve high accuracy by optimizing the model. 

As an optional exercise, we may also use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data set although we have not analyzed the data to make that decison yet. 

We will also make a set of recommendations to prevent churn in our presentation.
